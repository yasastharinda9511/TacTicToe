# Introductions

The all the decisions are made by using alpha beta prunning algorithms.Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number
of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing 
of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move 
to be worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, 
it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
